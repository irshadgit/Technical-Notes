R objects 
	
	Importance of Data in R 
			Staticstical computing needs data in specific format


	Basic types 
		numercal,character,logical

	Assignment 
		x <- 7 

Data Objects in R 

	Vector
		Group of same type - Numerical,character etc

		data(rivers)

		rivers[10:20]

		c() function 
		rivers[c(25,35)]
		rivers[rivers > 5]
		x = 100:200 
		x = c("Nimish","Arun","Unais","Vineeth")
		z <- c(x,y)
		
		Named Vectors 
			islands
			names(x) = c("","")
			x["name"]

			km_islands <- islands * 2.59


	Matrices and Arrays
	
		Matrices
			Two dimensional arrays 
			y = matrix(1:16, nrow=4)
		Arrays

			Is like a matrix with more than 2 dimensions

					y = array(1:16, dim=c(4,2,2))
			"dim" option gives the number of rows, columns and layers
	Tables
		table() - To create frequency tables or cross tabulations in a raw data ( vector, dataframe)
		It is more like arrays / matrix

		y = rnorm(100, mean=100, sd=15) 
		tableY = table(y)

		More about HairEyeColor
			4*4*2 - Cross tablulation table
			margin.table(HairEyeColor,c(1,3))
	
	List
		Collection of other R objects collected to one place
		items in the list are indexed by double brackets.
		named list 
			names(my.list)	=
			my.list$nameKey


	DataFrames
		
		Basically list :) 
			women
			women[c(1:10)]
			Type of variables and all 
				tips
					numerical variables
					categorical variables
				summary()
		race = scan(what="character")
		my.data = data.frame(name, age, hgt, wgt, race, year, SAT)			

		
		

		dim(mydataframe)
		names(mydataframe)
		dimnames(mydataframe)
		Accessing Data Frame 
			by using $
			by using with( )
			by using data=
			by using attach( )

	Data Frame Indexing and Row Names
		
		my.data[3,4] 
		my.data[3,"wgt"]
		my.data["3","wgt"]

		rownames 
			dataframe has rownames. When we print it is the one shows there. we can change rownames using rownames(mydataframe) <- c()
		add new columns by
			mydataframe$newcolumn <- c()
