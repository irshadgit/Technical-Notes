	Think of an computer connects another one in somewhere

	Reference : http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-HTTP-protocol-and-TCP-protocol

	1- Physical Layer
		Physical layer with voltages and all 
	2- Link Layer
		Connects 2 physical layers (eg : routers)
	3- Network Layer (IP)
		Once it passes router this layer manages to reach to the system in the network
	4- Protocol Layer
	 	Once it reaches the other computer protocol layer determines to which program should it connect
	 	TCP/IP
	5- Application Layer
		So we've connected your browser to the web server software on the other end, but how does the server know what page you want? How can you post a question or an answer?
		HTTP for web traffic
		SMTP,IMAP,POP3 for Mail 
		Telnet, SSH, RDP for remote administration
