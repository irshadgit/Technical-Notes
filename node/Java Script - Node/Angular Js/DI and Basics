1- Data binding 2 way : 
2- Template controller scope : 


Dependency injection : 
	Services can be injected to controller while initilizing.
	Tackling minification : 
		2 ways we can tackle minifying issue on putting services as just argument to controller constructors.
			1- Use $inject propery and assaign array list of string for services needed.
			2- Use constructor as list of services and then function.

		ng-src directirve prevent get request with angular expression initially before initialising.
		It will happen if we add just src instead of ng-src


	DI bit deep : https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Dependency-Injection

		1- Custom service can be created using providers.
		2- Services can be injected to injectable functions : 
			Controllers.
		3- Can get providers by 
			myMod.config(function($provide){
			$provide.provider('greeting',function(){
			this.$get = function(){return function(name){
			alert('Alerting issss'+name);
			};
			};
			});
			});

			More easy ways to avoid get we can use factory,service and value services.
		4- Injector : 
			One who instantiates and supplies services using providers.
			Can get hold of by $injector. It knows to inject itself. 

				To get $injector just use $injector to any injectoble functions.
			Injectable Functions : 
				Functions which can inject services to argument are called injectable functions. $injector does this task as follows using invoke function.

					var myFunction = function(greeting) {
  						greeting('Ford Prefect');
						};
						$injector.invoke(myFunction);

			myMod.controller('mycontroller',function($injector){
				$injector.get('myService');
			}));

		5- Config and run : 
			app goes through 2 phases config phase and run phase.
			config phase initialises filters,expression etc.
			run just execute the app.
			can inject only providers for the service to config functions. Services cannot becuase theya have not been created.

			We can customize services using config phase. That is why there is a way of adding provider in config function.
