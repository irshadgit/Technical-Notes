Setting up maeven

	When we type the command specified in  the apaceh site it will create the pom.xml for our project
	
	unit test cases in maven
			We can write the logic of test cases of our project buy specifying test case. In maeven using mvn test command
			It will say whether it is failed or succes
			eg: For cost management if i write corresponding test case.java it maeven will check using the test case against corresponding project
	mvn package to create the war file
	
			First run mvn package from the main pom.xml directory
			Check which all files are missing
			Get the corresponding files from the server and download those to local maeven
					Maeven wont be having some jars which are required
								A script under our server will do the stuffs
								
	You will get the war file then :)
