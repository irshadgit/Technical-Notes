	Tutorial about the session time out thing
	
		Flex remote procedure calls
			It uses BlazeDs method (NOt sure about it)
				
				Working
							When a flex remote call hits the server in server inside webinf there will be an xml file called romoteconfig.xml
							Which will map for every call what class should be called [eg:com.frameworks.mpp.netezza].
							
							In those function sangeetheten wrote a function to check validity of the session if valdiate(context) is null. Then it will
							show the session time out properly. 
							
								Recently they have changed it to serviecepojo validateSession(context)
