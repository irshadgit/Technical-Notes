Started Flex 
	imported swc file from hudson to flash builder
	and done some steps before starting project [ Adding root file and all and setting up output folder and all]
	
	
	
	Interaction of swf files in web applications
			User request for server page
			1	->	page contains the java,php codes which can use system resources directly
			2	->	Data is then added into an html page and it is send back to the sever
			
			Flex comes in 2 the swf file which is compiled by flash player is send to client lap top embedded in html code
			Once the client gets the swf file it can communicate to the server directly without server requests and all other stuff
