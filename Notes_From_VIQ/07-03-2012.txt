VIQ code works

	We have all the code in svn server
	Hudson will take care of building the code. Hudson will build the project using maeven or something

When we copying to our local system

	Should take the war from hudson by downloading the war file
				Should go to the server http://10.200.13.49:8181/ for hudson
				Go to the project 
				Download the war 
						Go to the hudson server
						Check the version
						workspace
						iq/target/ u will find the war
						
	Export the war file to eclipse
	
	There wont be any codes in the src since its war file. Inorder to get the codes 
		Copy paste the codes from svn to the com in eclipse
			Go to the directry in svn where the codes resides for that particular app usually version no/iq-resources/src/main/java [Exclude the conf folder]
			
	After that run it on the server and configure it properly
		According to the errors showing up do the changes
			Eg: Client.properties may dont have version= the client name etc
			Because of the building difference [Hudson and eclipse] there will be some change fix those also
